# Nail-Business-Analytics-Dashboard (Interactive)
## Project Objective 
I created a data analytics dashboard designed for independent nail technicians to track and analyze key business metrics. I used Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and Power BI to create interactive visualizations. 

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/shaoshaooo/Nail-Business-Analytics-Dashboard/blob/main/Sample_Nail_Business_Dataset.csv">Nail Business Sample Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- Find a visual relashionship between nail lengths and price set for them using a donut chart
- What are the most popular nail shapes booked?
- What are the locations of our clients?
- What's a quick way of seeing numerical results such an average tips?
- Dashboard Interaction - <a href = "https://github.com/shaoshaooo/Nail-Business-Analytics-Dashboard/blob/main/nail%20business%20dashboard.png"> View Dashboard Image </a>
  
##  Process
- Used Pandas in Jupyter Notebook to fill missing data cells in columns such as Discounts Applied with "None"
- Used replace method to replace data cells with nail length from "Small", "Medium", "Large" to "S", "M", "L"
- In Power BI, I first added an AI Q&A Visual to answer questions like maximum tips, average earning, sum of price quickly
- I created donut chart for nail length and price relation, map feature to locate our clients, and treemap to visualise popular nail shapes.
